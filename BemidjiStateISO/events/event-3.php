                  The Festival of Nations will continue its legacy as the longest running multicultural festival at Bemidji State University – one that celebrates
                  cultural heritage and provides diverse students, employees, and community members with a platform to express their stories through multicultural performances,
                  exhibits, ethnic foods, and
                  personal connections. We look forward to seeing you at the festival on Friday, April 13th.
